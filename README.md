## Background Information

The development of MIMO-OFDM enables the unique characterization of each point in a scene through multi-path effects. Fingerprint-based localization methods utilize channel information that reflects multi-path features, such as received signal strength (RSS), channel impulse response (CIR), channel frequency response (CFR), and angle-delay channel amplitude matrix (ADCAM), as fingerprints to infer coordinates. However, current fingerprint localization algorithms typically select a single type of channel information as the fingerprint, failing to fully capture the distinctiveness of each location. This leads to situations where distant points within a scene exhibit nearly identical fingerprints, thereby violating the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data and significantly degrading localization accuracy.

To address this issue, conventional methods often manually partition the region into regular grids (e.g., rectangular grids) and iteratively reduce the grid size until the fingerprint that best matches the test sample is found. However, such regular division methods are inadequate for complex real-world scenarios, especially in the presence of irregular physical structures, such as buildings and scatterers, where the multi-path effects of samples within the grid may not exhibit high similarity. Furthermore, while existing irregular grid division methods have improved performance and accuracy, generating irregular grids often incurs high computational costs and fails to ensure consistent similarity among fingerprints within a grid.

Additionally, existing inference methods primarily establish a direct mapping between fingerprints and coordinates, overlooking issues such as regional covariates and heterogeneous data distributions during the inference process. These methods perform poorly in scenarios where fingerprints of neighboring locations exhibit high similarity and are prone to cumulative errors when the initial positioning is inaccurate. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further enhance AI-driven fingerprint localization algorithms to effectively address the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, improving localization accuracy and robustness.

## Program Execution Order

All steps are contained within `compute_offset_WAIRD.ipynb`, acting as the main function. Open the program and execute it according to the outlined steps.

1. Data Preprocessing

    a. Refer to [Dataset Generation](#dataset-generation) to generate the dataset.

    b. Run `gentarget_waird_git.py`.

    c. Run the 5th step of `templatematching_waird.py` in PyCharm.

    d. Follow the steps in `compute_offset_WAIRD.ipynb`.

2. Neural Network Training

    a. Modify the model by `sipml_shuai.py` in PyCharm.

    b. Run `train_CNN_shuai.py` in PyCharm to generate a CNN benchmark for training and comparing with our results.

    c. Run `train_prior_shuai.py` in PyCharm to produce the results processed by the AMDNLOC framework.

3. Visualization

    a. Run specific parts of `draw.ipynb` as a reference. 

    b. Write the code and draw whatever you need. 

p.s. Just run the code in order. Notes/reminders have already been written at the beginning of each cell. Chinese comments in the code won't affect the normal execution of the program.
